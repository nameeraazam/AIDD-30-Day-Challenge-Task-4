6. Practical Task — Build the Study Notes
Summarizer & Quiz Generator Agent

After Context7 is connected, you will create an agent using:
● OpenAgents SDK
● Streamlit (recommended for UI, but HTML/CSS is allowed your choice)
● PyPDF (for PDF text extraction)
● Gemini CLI
● Context7 MCP (tool provider)

What the Agent Will Do
A. PDF Summarizer
● User uploads a PDF.
● Text is extracted using PyPDF.
● Agent generates a clean, meaningful summary.
● Summary can appear in any UI style students choose (card, block,
container, etc.).

B. Quiz Generator
● After summarization, the user can click Create Quiz.
● The agent reads the original PDF (not the summary).
● It generates:
○ MCQs
○ Or mixed-style quizzes

This is the core required functionality but students can add more features if they
want, but these two are the minimum.
